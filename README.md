# flutter_app

My first ever Flutter application.


## Getting Started


It is just a demo of a flutter app where I have implemented 
- a drawer to show some options for a user.
- added an image on the top of the drawer
- made a list in the dashboard where some title with short description about the titles are there.
- depending on the chosen option, it will show the details of that particular title with an image.

Data is fetched from a JSON file witch is present in the assets folder. I have passed the objects from Dashboard to the Details page.


I took help from this link: https://flutter.dev/docs. I hope, you will get help too.
